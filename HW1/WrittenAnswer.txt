1. Answer is false, since (4 <= 2) is false. Although  (True || (8^2 == 3)) is true
however, both do not reduce down to truth logic. You get a reduction to FALSE && TRUE != TRUE

2. 8 * (succ 3) + (max 40 15) = 72
    Since:
        succ 3 = 4;
        4 * 8 = 32;
        max(40 15) = 40;
        sum(40 32) = 72; QED

3. 5 + (succ 2 4)- false logic no answer

    Error is presented when trying to find the succ(2 4) since succ only takes in one argument
    Therefore it would have to be either 2 or 4 but not both.

4. "I have " ++ (f 2) ++ " dogs"

    Returns a false statement since f(2) is not properly cast as a string to combine with the rest of the sentence. You would need to
    cast show (f 2) to properly print out that "I have 6 dogs" otherwise, you cannot combine intergers with strings


5. f (max (f 3)) 8 - incorrect arguments inside function

    - max requires two arguments however it is only presented one which is the evaluation of the f(x) function
