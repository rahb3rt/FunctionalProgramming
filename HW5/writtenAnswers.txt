1.  f [3,4,5]
    Returns a non exhausted pattern since it has no rule for
    termination when the array reaches null

2. g 5 = 56
    5 gets evaluated at g x, which then repeats recursivly
    until g 0 which equals 1. 25 + 16 + 9 + 4 + 1 + 1

3. map (>3) [1..5] [ false, false, false, true, true]

    Checks all values from 1 to 5 and if they are greater than 3
    returns true, else false.

4. map (drop 1) (map (take 3) ["Hello","mother","dear"])
    ["el","ot","ea"]

    Takes presenence on the individual elements first
    instead of on the array itself to return the the mapping of
    the individual elements instead of the whole array.
