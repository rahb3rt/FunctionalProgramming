1.) f [3..8]
    - In order for the application to run it requires a
      single argument '[3..8]' provides an array of 5
      numbers which surpass the limit of input inside the
      function

2.) [ f x | x <- [3..8] ]

    - ["creed","creed","hootie","nickelback","nickelback","nickelback"]
    - Takes in each number from 3..8 and runs it against the
      function each number at a time since in this form the
      function can take an array and iterate through it

3.) g [3..8]

    -Takes the first element of the list and if the first
    element is equal to three it equals 8

4.) [ g x | x <- [3..8] ]

    - Spits out an error since the argument required for the
      g function takes in a list and not individual numbers
      in order to take teh functino and takes its first
      element but individual elements do not have lists

5.) g[]

    - Returns an error since the list that is being input is
      blank and there is no function currently that handles
      a blank list input
